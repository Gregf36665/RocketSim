This rocket simulation plots altitude velocity and aacceleration of a sub-sonic rocket flying through the air.
The simulation works by calculating the forces on the rocket at instances in time (0.005 sec).
The drag force is calculated by using the density of air (based on altitude) and the area of the rocket,
and the parachute after it has been depolyed
